<p style="text-indent: 1.5em">ADO.NET provides consistent access to data sources such as SQL Server and XML, and to data sources exposed through OLE DB and ODBC.  Data-sharing consumer applications can use ADO.NET to connect to these data sources and retrieve, handle, and update the data that they contain.  
ADO.NET separates data access from data manipulation into discrete components that can be used separately or in tandem.  ADO.NET includes .NET Framework data providers for connecting to a database, executing commands, and retrieving results.</p>

<h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Architecture</h2>
<p style="text-indent:1.5em">ADO.NET is conceptually divided into consumers and data providers. The consumers are the applications that need access to the data, and the providers are the software components that implement the interface and thereby provide the data to the consumer.
Functionality exists in Visual Studio IDE to create specialized subclasses of the DataSet classes for a particular database schema, allowing convenient access to each field through strongly typed properties. This helps catch more programming errors at compile-time and enhances the IDE's Intellisense feature.</p>
